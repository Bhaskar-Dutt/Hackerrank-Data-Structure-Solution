# Hackerrank-Data-Structure-Solution
This Repository has the answers for the Hackerrank Data Structures questions
The Solutions has been separated as they have done on Hackerrank 

Note:The Solutions in this Project are my own codes and they may or may not be the most efficient solutions but they do pass
    all the testcases of the Hackerrank.
    So If you have more Efficient Solution than what is written in these codes. Feel free to contribute.
    
    Thank you
